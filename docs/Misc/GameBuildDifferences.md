# Game Build Differences

When a game is released and when a game is built are two different things.

The game release dates per region came from [www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)](www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(video_game))

So what we see here is that there's about a month between the final build of the games and their release.  But we also see that they were not built at the same time.  

While not always the case with games, there are a handful of differences between games these builds depending on when they were built, even if they were released at the same time.

For example, the versions build on Oct 16th and later have the powerful Chaos Control Glitch patched. Making the US GameCube and PS2 versions the only ones that can perform that glitch.
